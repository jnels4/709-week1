# 709-week1
Week 1 709 Reflection: 

Top Take-aways: 
- Compiled vs interpreted languages
- Printf print formatting, very similar to python, makes typing output a bit easier
- Importing new classes to our java programs (scanner + random), also very similar to python
- Not a huge fan of having to declare variables the way they are in java, but i’ll get over it 
- Semi-colons
- Semi-colons
- Did i mention semi-colons?


Surprises:
- Java and python are pretty similar while being quite distinct
- Environment setup wasn’t too bad
- The link b/w scratch + java is something i can bring to my students
- Importing classes and using functions from them is pretty confusing with the having to use the “new” command.
- Random was confusing typing random a few times in a row, it wasn’t very clear what this was doing


Implementing:
- Something i already do is breaking down lessons in “need to knows” then asking students to expand on that, i’ll continue bringing that to my lessons
- Drawing the similarity b/w snap + java & python

Moving forward:
- Definitely need more practice with java
- I want to learn more about conditionals and loops to make more robust mini-apps
